### Performance History Search

#### Excerpt from Narrative
The online Performance History Search (PHS) is an HTML presentation of every event – musical and nonmusical – that has occurred in the public performance spaces of Carnegie Hall (CH) since 1891. The PHS was the first step in a process to facilitate wider access to what CH has to offer. It establishes a useful foundation for broader engagement with current and historical data, assets, and more.

This capture was made so the functionality, “look & feel”, and user experience of the original PHS could be represented for future archival reference and research. On May 14, 2018, Archives staff created this capture as a representation of the functional requirements of the PHS. The capture demonstrates 15 use cases based on real researcher requests, anecdotal searches, and common questions.

#### Notes on Capture
- Some of the queries described in the Script resulted in error pages (due to the functionality that was requested failing). Is there a better way to represent this than simply organizing the 2 results in a list called "[Error Pages](https://webrecorder.io/CHArchives/carnegie-hall---performance-history-search-2018/list/error-pages)"? 
- Experienced Markdown formatting challenges in Script due to numbering/list issues. Still working on resolving this.
