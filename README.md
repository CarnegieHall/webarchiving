## Web Archiving Purpose Statement

The Carnegie Hall Archives aims to create a historic web record of Carnegie Hall, available for internal reference and limited public use. The Archives will collaborate with each Department to capture a representative sample of their web resources. The preserved, curated materials will depict the content, style, and impact of the Hallâ€™s online initiatives.
