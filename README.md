# Carnegie Hall Web Archiving

## What is this repository for?
Resources and language in this repository are all a work-in-progress. The Carnegie Hall Archives is researching and working on web archiving: identifying possible sites to capture as an expansion to our Digital Collections, establishing description practices, and reviewing access options. 

For recommendations and feedback, please see the [Feedback](#feedback) section below.

## Web Archiving Purpose Statement

The Carnegie Hall Archives aims to create a historic web record of Carnegie Hall, available for internal reference and limited public use. The Archives will collaborate with each Department to capture a representative sample of their web resources. The preserved, curated materials will depict the content, style, and impact of the Hallâ€™s online initiatives.

CH Archives welcomes your thoughts, questions, and recommendations on our evolving web archiving strategies.
