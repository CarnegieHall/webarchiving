# Carnegie Hall Web Archiving

## What is this repository for?
Resources and language in this repository are all a work-in-progress. The [Carnegie Hall Archives](https://www.carnegiehall.org/About/History/Archives) is researching and working on web archiving: identifying possible sites to capture as an expansion to the Carnegie Hall (CH) Digital Collections, establishing description practices, and reviewing access options. 

## Web Archiving Purpose Statement

The Carnegie Hall Archives aims to create a historic record of Carnegie Hall's websites, available for internal reference and limited public use. The Archives will collaborate with each Department to capture a representative sample of their web resources. The preserved, curated materials will depict the content, style, and impact of the Hallâ€™s online initiatives.
