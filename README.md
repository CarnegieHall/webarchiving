# Carnegie Hall Web Archiving

## What is this repository for?
Resources and language in this repository are all a work-in-progress. The [Carnegie Hall Archives](https://www.carnegiehall.org/About/History/Archives) is researching and working on web archiving: identifying possible sites to capture as an expansion to the Carnegie Hall (CH) Digital Collections, establishing description practices, and reviewing access options.

## Web Archiving Purpose Statement

The Carnegie Hall Archives aims to create a historic record of Carnegie Hall's websites, available for internal reference and limited public use. The Archives will collaborate with each Department to capture a representative sample of their web resources. The preserved, curated materials will depict the content, style, and impact of the Hall’s online initiatives.  

## Workplan

This proposed workplan summarizes planned activities.

### 1. **Identify** sites and pages with artistic, technological, or historical value for potential capture

Identify sites that require manual capture with [Webrecorder](http://webrecorder.io/), and are more difficult to represent in tools like the Internet Archive’s [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/), [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/), or [Archive-IT](https://archive-it.org/).

#### 1a. Assemble comprehensive inventory of all active and legacy Carnegie Hall-related sites
- Ask staff to help identify existing (or recently dead) sites of interest across departments, teams, projects, or initiatives
- Research and prioritize sites to capture
- Define the specific goal of each project capture
- Determine which sites are not represented adequately in the Wayback Machine, and require additional Webrecorder capture 

### 2. Develop web archive capture cataloging process

#### 2a. Solicit input and needs from colleagues at CH
#### 2b. Review archival community engagement and recommended practices
#### 2c. Create local rules for how to document capture details/notes, including the following project components:
- **Narrative** (collection scope per capture answering: what was original purpose of site? What did it achieve? Who was it used by? Why was it developed/maintained? When/why is was removed or retired?)
-	**Script** (describes steps of capture)
-	**WARC** (capture of site, in Webrecorder, local copy in Archives storage)

### 3. Capture and describe web resources

Department requesting a site to be captured will lead the capture, with support from Archives, and create the Narrative and Script components. 

### 4. Maintain and make web archives available for access
#### 4a. Through Webrecorder.io
[Add performance history warc]

#### 4b. Review options for representing captures in existing Digital Collections system
